# EV Clarity - Savings Calculator
General Assembly ADI - Cornerstone Project

The EV Clarity app helps drivers answer one question: will you save money on fuel/energy costs by driving an electric vehicle?

EV clarity was designed with precision and driver convenience in mind. Your drives are automatically recorded using the GPS in your device, and EV Clarity knows when you're in a vehicle so there's no need to open the app every time you drive.

Predicted monthly savings are based on:

- local gas price
- local utility provider
- current vehicle's MPG
- miles driven
- a Nissan Leaf's cost/mile driven.

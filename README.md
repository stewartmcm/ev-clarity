Electric Vehicle Savings Calculator

The EV Clarity app helps drivers answer one question: will you save money by switching to an electric vehicle?

Every time you drive, EV Clarity automatically records your mileage and then tells you how much you would have saved if you were driving an electric vehicle (based on your local gas price, local electricity rate, and current vehicle MPG).

EV Clarity is context-aware, which means it knows when you're driving, walking, sitting still, etc., so there's no need for you to open up the app every time you plan on driving. Thanks to your device's built-in sensors, EV Clarity can do all of the work for you while you go about your daily routine. 

Predicted monthly savings are based on:

- local gas price
- local utility provider
- current vehicle's MPG
- miles driven
- a Nissan Leaf's cost/mile driven.
